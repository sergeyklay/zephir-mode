# Zephir Mode for GNU Emacs

[![travis badge][travis-badge]][travis-link]

A GNU Emacs major mode for editing Zephir code.

The mode heavily inspired by [`php-mode`][php-mode] and based on the
[`derived-mode-ex.el`][derived-mode] code supported with the `cc-mode`.

## Installation

Known to work with GNU Emacs 24 and later. Zephir Mode may work with older
versions of Emacs but this is not guaranteed. Bug reports for problems related
to using Zephir Mode with older versions of Emacs will most like _not_ be
addressed.
