# Zephir Mode for GNU Emacs

[![travis badge][travis-badge]][travis-link]

This project introduces Zephir Mode for GNU Emacs.

The code borrowed from or heavily inspired by [`php-mode`][php-mode]. This mode
based on the [`derived-mode-ex.el`][derived-mode] code supported with the
`cc-mode`.

## Installation

Known to work with GNU Emacs 24 and later. Zephir Mode may work with older
versions of Emacs but this is not guaranteed. Bug reports for problems related
to using Zephir Mode with older versions of Emacs will most like _not_ be
addressed.
